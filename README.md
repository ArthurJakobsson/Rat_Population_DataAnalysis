# Rat Population Data Analysis - New York City

## Descriptions of Datasets

### Rat dataset

https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/Rat-Sightings/3q43-55fe

Our analysis primarily revolves around this dataset, with several supplementary datasets appended to this one for further in-depth analysis. This dataset contains 208,000 different rat sightings in the City of New York between 2010 to the present day, reported by citizens to the City of New York and accessed from NYC Open Data. 38 different variables are recorded for each sighting; notably, geographic data such as latitude, longitude, and borough data, and the date of opening and closing of the complaint. 

### Supplementary Datasets

#### Subway Dataset

## Research Questions

Going into this project, our group had several questions we wanted to answer regarding the distribution of rats in the city. Namely:

* How has the number of rats reported changed over time?
* How have policies intended to reduce the number of rats in NYC affected rat sightings?
* How do rat sightings differ geographically and by borough?
* How do rat sightings correlate with candidate features such as subways and restaurants?
* How does well do wealth and geographic data combined correlate with rat sightings?

In all, we hope to make underlying observations that extend beyond the mere topic of rats, using rat sightings as a proxy for deeper conclusions about socioeconomic and geographic patterns in the City of New York.
