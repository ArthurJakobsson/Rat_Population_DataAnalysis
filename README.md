# Rat Population Data Analysis - New York City

## Descriptions of Datasets

### Rat dataset

https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/Rat-Sightings/3q43-55fe

This dataset contains 208,000 different rat sightings in the City of New York between 2010 to the present day, reported by citizens to the City of New York and accessed from NYC Open Data. 38 different variables are recorded for each sighting; notably, geographic data such as latitude, longitude, and borough data, and the date of opening and closing of the complaint. 

## Research Questions

Going into this project, our group had several questions we wanted to answer regarding the distribution of rats in the city. Namely:

* How has the number of rats reported changed over time?
* How have policies intended to reduce the number of rats in NYC affected rat sightings?
* How do rat sightings differ geographically?
* How discriminative can the borough of a rat sighting be in determining the characteristics of the sighting?
